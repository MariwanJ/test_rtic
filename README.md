Sample project for RTIC - Rust for Nucleo-f767 (stm32f767xx) boards (Async - multi tasking)


## Sample project for RTIC - Embdded Rust
Based on the samples provided by the library, I modified this to work with the Nucleo-F767ZI board. I also added more tasks so that the three LEDs on the board toggle asynchronously with different delays.

Use it at your own risk!
